If we had a fusion reactor, how much would someone pay for it? 
The value of the device, and therefore its maximum economically competitive cost is, roughly, the sum of the costs of the solar panels, batteries, firm generation, fuel, and tranmission lines that would need to be purchased if we didn't have the fusion plant.
This is a finite number!

I, along with Wilson Ricks, Egemen Kolemen, and Jesse Jenkins, wrote [an article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09373) examining this in the context of a net-zero-carbon electric grid in the future United States.
It is is currently under review in _Joule_.
We also wrote a [research digest](https://control.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/418/2022/10/Research_Digest-Value_of_Fusion.pdf) which summarizes the key points.
