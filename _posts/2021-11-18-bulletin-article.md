Rob Goldston and I wrote [an article](https://thebulletin.org/premium/2021-11/fusions-role-in-fighting-climate-change/) for Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. You can read it!

There's not a CRediT statement, but most of the present text was written by Rob. I had some more technical paragraphs that ended up being cut. I also helped with fact checking, some numbers, and some specific language.
