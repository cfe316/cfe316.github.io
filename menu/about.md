I'm a postdoctoral researcher in Princeton's Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department. I'm currently developing a zero-D systems code for fusion reactors and studying the value of fusion for future electric grids and more broadly, energy systems.

I was previously a [graduate student](https://plasma.princeton.edu/people/jacob-schwartz) in Princeton's Program in Plasma Physics. My thesis work was on developing a piece of technology with application for nuclear fusion reactors.
