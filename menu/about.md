I'm a staff research physicist at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. 

Before this I was a postdoc at Princeton University, working with the Plasma Control Group to develop an open-source "systems code" for tokamaks, and with ZERO Lab to study fusion's value as part of future electricity markets.

I was previously a [graduate student](https://plasma.princeton.edu/people/jacob-schwartz) in Princeton's Program in Plasma Physics. My thesis work was on developing a piece of technology with application for nuclear fusion reactors.
